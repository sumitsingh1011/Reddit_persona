I am from Kashmir not sure if anyone knows where it is but i'd say it's kinda like the shire, the mesmerizing beauty, the kindness of people who just want to keep to themselves and not get involved in unnecessary drama, anyway long story short I have been a huge fan of the movies since i watched them for the first time. Talking about the trilogy both lotr and hobbit, the animated ones and also the recent tv  show. I have also played most of the games based on the lore.\n\nNow i want to start reading the books, where it all began so if any of you good people could recommend where to begin and where it ends i would be grateful. Plus my dm's are open to all mellons. I would love to make acquaintance of you my fellowship members. Thanks for listening and Nam\u00e1ri\u00eb.",
