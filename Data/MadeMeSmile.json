The staffing agency just needs bodies to fill the slots. \nIf the company likes your work,\nthey could offer you a position with them after a certain amount of time. Which usually pays better, since the staffing agencies get a few extra dollars per hour to find the workers etc. \nI\u2019m sure they are going to mention drug testing in the paper work. Which obviously made me start sweating bullets. But they sent me to my first assignment without requesting it. Though in the paperwork they mentioned it will be required if you get hurt on the job. Which they would then use to disqualify any responsibilities for your injuries. Just giving you a heads up.",
